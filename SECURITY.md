## 🧠 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, **do not** open a public issue.  
Instead, please contact us directly using one of the following methods:

- Email: `secure.bunlock@gmail.com`
- Or, use GitHub’s [Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories) to report privately.

When reporting, please include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Potential impact or affected components.
- (Optional) Suggested fixes or mitigations.

We aim to acknowledge your report within **72 hours** and provide a response or patch plan shortly after.

## ⚠️ Responsible Disclosure

Please avoid publicly disclosing vulnerabilities until they have been fixed and released.  
We strongly discourage sharing any exploits or sensitive information in public forums.

## 🧩 Non-Accepted Reports

For clarity, the following will **not** be treated as valid vulnerabilities:
- Root access obtained from user-consented actions.
- Device unlocks performed with manufacturer authorization.
- Outdated Android versions with known, unpatched flaws.
- Any exploit or bypass that violates local laws or third-party policies.
